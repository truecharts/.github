        Thanks for making this bug report.
        
        - Chart version, means **our** version
        - Apps in the *incubator* train, **CANNOT be reported as outdated**, as they might not even be functional at all
        - Apps in the *stable* train, can be reported after the container update is at least **1 month old**
        - Apps in the *premium* and *system* trains, can be reported after the container update is **at least 7 days old**
